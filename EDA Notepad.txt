### Using this as a note taking pad ###

Men seem to be slightly more likely to repeat plays, but the numbers don't support
a significant difference between genders.

My library is definitely the preferred area for users to access their music followed 
by Discover. 

There is definitely some strong preferences among users for their entry points
with music on the streaming service. Look at the Source Screen Name feature.
Local playlist more, Online playlist more, Radio, and Album more make up the
majority of entry points. Somewhat surprisingly My Library is not.

Hmmm, strong relationship found between target and the Source Screen Name.
Most of the SSN categories show a bias towards non-repeated plays. However,
Local playlist more shows a notable bias towards repeated plays. This would
make sense I think, a local playlist could be assumed to contain music the user
likes and would listen to again. There's also purposed playlists like 
"workout" and "motivation" playlists that a user may use frequently and would
thus lead to more repeated plays. 

^ a look at similarities in the genres and source screen name/tab features may
  help dimensionalize this better
  
Similar relationship is seen wrt to joint distribution of target values among 
source screen name categories. Biased towards non-repeats with all classes 
except "My Library" where there's a bias towards repeat plays. Also makes sense
as a user would be more likely to listen to songs they've added to their personal
library more than once.
